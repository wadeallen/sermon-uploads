# Instructions

This repository contains the necessary scripts for preparing and uploading the sermons from First Baptist Muncie.

1. Move the MTS files from the SD Card to your computer. This can be done by simply copying the files over in a file manager. I use a bash script that creates a folder on my desktop and places the files in that folder. The files are located on the SD card in the following directory.

`/PRIVATE/AVCHD/BDMV/STREAM/`
